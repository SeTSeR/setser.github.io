Hey, I'm Sergey and I'm a student, Linux user and C developer. I've been coding since 2012. While I was attending school, I learned several languages and technologies, including Java, Android, Hibernate, Kotlin, C and Haskell, some examples can be found [in my repo](https://github.com/SeTSeR). I'm deeply interested in programming languages design and compiler technologies. In particular, I'm learning now low-level programming language, called [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
